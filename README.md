# Team-Profile-Generator

## Desciption
This project was created so we can test out how to test and run those test using jest in the command line. The tests were one of the harder parts of this unit but were still good to use and test code to see if it would pass or fail. It was almost along the same line with the last project just with extra things involed such as adding cards and the tests for example.
